Feedback
========

An Omeka plugin for saving user feedback on pages.

Currently, this just provides a POST action which creates a feedback item and, if
sender and recipient are configured, sends a notification email.

TODO:

 - Expand README
 - Handle CSRF
 - More validation/Capcha?
 - Public interface/form/JS
